As a result, the development of residential structures with up to three units will be allowed in all neighborhoods.

In 2019, he pushed for $100 million in funding for the state’s <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/service-details/massachusetts-rental-voucher-program-mrvp\">rental voucher program</a> and established the <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/housing-choice-initiative\">Housing Choice Initiative</a>, which dedicates more than $10 million a year in incentives, grant funding and technical assistance to enable the development of 135,000 new housing units by 2025.
